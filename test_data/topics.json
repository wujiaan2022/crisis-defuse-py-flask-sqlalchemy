    "content": "✨ This article gathers the heartfelt teachings of Master Lu on why meditation can be dangerous for those without spiritual foundation or guidance. He compassionately explains the unseen spiritual dangers that many modern seekers are unaware of.\n\n---\n\n🧘‍♂️ **2017-11-10 | Why Sitting Cross-Legged Is Dangerous**  \n**Question:** A fellow practitioner found sitting cross-legged beneficial to his health. He wonders if this breaks the 'no meditation' guideline.\n\n**Master Lu:** The moment you cross your legs, you're opening energy channels to the underworld. If you cannot connect to heavenly energy, but only open the lower realm, you're at risk of spiritual disturbance or karmic creditors finding you. Your body may feel good, but your spiritual risk increases. It's like walking around with your fingers shaped like a gun — it may feel fine to you, but others (including spiritual forces) will misunderstand.\n\nThe safest posture is lying down peacefully (Auspicious Sleeping Posture) with a clear mind, gently reciting scriptures. You do not need cross-legged meditation to progress.\n\n---\n\n🌿 **2012-04-15A | Don’t Sit Cross-Legged While Reciting**  \n**Question:** Should we avoid cross-legged sitting during sutra recitation?\n\n**Master Lu:** Yes. Sitting cross-legged can open the connection to the spirit world. It’s like lying in bed — even if you don’t intend to sleep, sleep may come. Likewise, cross-legged posture makes you prone to entering a deep state of meditation, opening energy channels beyond your control. Without spiritual strength, you cannot choose what energy you connect to.\n\n---\n\n🌀 **2018-01-12 | Why You Can’t Meditate Without Spiritual Power**  \n**Question:** Meditation is often said to calm the mind and strengthen sutra practice. Why discourage it?\n\n**Master Lu:** Because most people **cannot truly calm their mind**. The moment you attempt to meditate, you may open yourself to earth energy without being able to receive heaven’s energy. If a spirit is nearby, they may attach to you — especially if you owe karmic debts. You have no defense against such influence.\n\nMeditation is for those with strong concentration and spiritual power. Without it, it’s like sending someone into a dangerous group untrained — they will be influenced and harmed.\n\n---\n\n🚫 **2014–2019 | Why Meditation and Visualization Can Lead to Possession**  \n**Master Lu:**\n- When the heavenly gate (top of the head) doesn’t open, but the earth gate (lower body) does, you connect to the underworld.\n- Many Westerners love meditation. But if they meditate while thinking about business or life problems, they cannot connect upward. Spirits come instead.\n- A company CEO died from spiritual interference while meditating.\n- A woman who searched online for “how to open third eye” began predicting illnesses. At first it seemed accurate. But later, the spirit possessed her and refused to leave, even speaking through her.\n\nThese are **not spiritual powers from Buddhas**. These are ghostly powers (known as “ghost powers,” not divine ones). They come easily, but they don’t leave easily.\n\n---\n\n⚠️ **On Playing with Spirit Energy**  \n**Master Lu:**\n- Don’t play spiritual games or attempt visualization without guidance.\n- One girl joined a “spiritual game” and became mentally ill afterward — smiling, crying, and yelling at random. The ghost stayed with her permanently.\n- Spirits can cause mental illness, hallucinations, speech changes, or complete breakdown. This is what the world calls “demonic possession.”\n\n---\n\n🌊 **About Hearing High-Pitched Sounds During Recitation**  \n**Question:** I hear high-pitched sounds while reciting sutras. Is that spiritual?\n\n**Master Lu:** It can be spiritual — or it may be ear-related. But often, if you’ve done any meditation or sat on the ground (especially directly on the floor), you may have opened a spiritual connection. And if your mind is not clear, this may invite lower energy. Be cautious.\n\nDon’t sit on the ground. Sit on a cushion or chair, always a little elevated. Never use the same cushion you bow on. Keep your energy sacred and safe.\n\n---\n\n📿 **The Power of the Buddhist Scripture Combination**  \nIf you have karmic debt or are affected by spirit interference, the safest and most effective remedy is the **Buddhist Scripture Combination** — a sacred offering composed of selected sutras. With consistent recitation and offering, spirits may receive your merit and release their hold on you.\n\nThis is **not superstition**, but a compassionate bridge between realms. Master Lu taught this to protect us — because karmic resolution is not always visible, but always real.\n\n---\n\n🌈 **The Safest Practice: Recitation and Mind-Cultivation**  \n**Master Lu:** Reciting scriptures while cultivating the heart is the **safest**, most blessed way to change your destiny.\n\nBuddhas and Bodhisattvas protect those who practice with sincerity and moral conduct. You don’t need meditation to achieve results — in fact, without guidance, it can be extremely dangerous.\n\n**Stay grounded. Recite. Cleanse the heart. Follow the path of light.**"
