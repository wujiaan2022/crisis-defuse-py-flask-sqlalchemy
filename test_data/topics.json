Master Lu offered numerous heartfelt teachings warning ordinary people of the hidden dangers. Below are three of the most essential.\n\n---\n\n### 1️⃣ Sitting Cross-Legged Can Open You to Spirits  \n**Excerpt from Wenda 2012-04-15A**\n\n> It’s best to simply sit upright while reciting scriptures. Sitting cross-legged puts you into a posture that can easily connect with the spiritual realm. You might not intend to meditate, but that position makes it easier to enter a meditative state. Once you're in that state — do you know what kind of energy you’re connecting to? Can you control it? Has your soul cultivated enough to safely travel between realms?\n\nMaster Lu reminds us: even good postures are not good for everyone. Just like lying down isn’t always sleep, sitting cross-legged can lead to unsafe connection if your mind isn’t pure.\n\n---\n\n### 2️⃣ Without Spiritual Power, Meditation Brings Deviation  \n**Excerpt from Wenda 2018-01-12**\n\n> Why don’t I let you meditate? Because your mind can’t stay still. When you try to meditate but cannot calm your thoughts, your lower energy channels may open without the upper ones. That’s when negative spirits can attach, and people fall into demonic deviation (走火入魔).\n\n> True meditation requires strong spiritual power. Without it, your mind is vulnerable. Just like sending someone with no discipline into a gang — they’ll fall into vices. Meditation is the same: if you don’t have control, you can’t resist spiritual interference.\n\n---\n\n### 3️⃣ If the Upper Gate Doesn’t Open, Only Darkness Enters  \n**Excerpt from Wenda 2014-AU**\n\n> When you meditate — especially sitting in full or half lotus — your energy channels open. If your Heavenly Gate (top of head) doesn’t open, but your Earth Gate (lower body) does, then you're only connecting to the underworld.\n\n> Spirits from your past karmic debts will find you. That’s why many people start seeing things, hearing voices, harming themselves — this is demonic deviation. You may gain energy, but if it's not from Heaven, it’s from below.\n\n> Even a CEO who meditated daily passed away early. Why? His mind was full of business worries — Heaven couldn’t connect, and ghosts came instead. Don’t assume meditation is safe just because it’s popular.\n\n---\n\n✨ These are just a few of Master Lu’s compassionate teachings to protect us from harm.
